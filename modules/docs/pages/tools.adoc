== Introduction

An overview of some of the tools used to work with the datasets covered on this website

== Core Tools

=== Operating System

Most of the work was done using https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] which provides a Linux
like environment on a Windows host. With Cygwin installed you can work in a shell 
command line environment writing scripts and taking full advantage of Unix utilities.
Extensive use was made of the best text editor around https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/vi.1p.html['vi']
An excellent http://www.ungerhu.com/jxh/vi.html[vi Reference] is available. This website
is largely written in vi using https://asciidoc-py.github.io/[AsciiDoc] mark up language
having been converted from Wordpress. Other tools include https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html[awk]
which is a programming language in itself, ideal for processing text files and scripting.
For processing CSV files into a UTF-8 character set https://linux.die.net/man/1/dos2unix[iconv]
proved invaluable as did https://linux.die.net/man/1/dos2unix[dos2unix] for file preparation.
Unix is ideal for one off manipulation of files, pattern matching and prototyping methods with
utilities such as grep and sed. These can the be formalised and written into shell scripts
that can chaned together to create data handling piplines that help automate processing.

=== Databases

When handling large amounts of data spreadsheets have their limits, for the heavy lifting 
https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] was used. I had some contact with PostgreSQL commercially 
in the past, I found installing and running the database to be very straight forward
I ran it under Cygwin and it performed perfectly and fully endorse PostgreSQL's own

____
_PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with
over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for
reliability, feature robustness, and performance._

Interaction with the data was largely through https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/plpgsql.html[PLpgSQL SQL Procedural Language]
having used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL[Transact-SQL] extensively in the past I 
found  PLpgSQL SQL easy to 'pick-up'.

For handling smaller datasets I found Google's free offering https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/[Google Sheets] useful,
setting up a Google account gives you full access with 15GB cloud storage. Sheets handle Excel's spreadsheet format well
providing a means to ingest and export them to CSV . I found 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdr8NYcMNDBaUmUsgygTWZWDv4HMpjfIpjsKzD_QHyw/edit#heading=h.8556luurwlj7[Liza Boltonâ€™s Data Journalism Workshop Notes]
a useful primer to using Sheets for handling datasets.

=== Other Tools

* https://dataminer.io/[Data Miner] - A Google Chrome Extension and Edge
 Browser Extension that helps you crawl and scrape data from web pages and
 into a CSV file or Excel spreadsheet.
* https://csvlint.io/[CSV Lint] - A CSV validator
* https://data.page/json/csv[JSON to CSV Converter] - Convert .json to .csv
* https://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm[SQL Formatter] - Format your SQL
 code for presentation, PLSQL. T-SQL and more.

== Data Visualisation Tools

* https://www.datawrapper.de/[Datawrapper] - Upload data and create charts, maps and tables. Create image files or embed in a website.
* https://flourish.studio/[Flourish] - Upload data and create charts, maps and tables. Create image files or embed in a website
* https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/[Google Sheet Charts] - Create charts from Google spreadsheets
* https://datastudio.google.com/[Google Data Studio] - Build interactive reports and dashboards, similar to Microsoft's Power BI

== Documentation

* This website was ported form Wordpress to a static site written in
 https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html[AsciiDoc], generated with
 https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] and built and themed with
