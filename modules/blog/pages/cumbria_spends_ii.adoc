== Update

I made a couple of changes form the xref:cumbria_spends_ii.adoc[last post] 
regarding the Cumbrian spend data. I recreated the council specific staging 
tables and added two leading columns.

[source]
----
nwod_id_uri_code - the council ONS code, eg E07000028
nwod_id          - an auto incrementing identity value for the row
----

I also scripted the loads and did a full re-run of the tasks outlined
previously. I’d emailed Copeland Borough Council and they got back to me very
promptly with the two missing months CSV files. Eden District Council also got
back to me with the corrected date data and provided me with 9 new files,
unfortunately the November2019 file still had the date problem. I’ve decided to
set aside Government Procurement card, credit card data for the time being.

== Next Steps

The six councils reported a different number of columns of data in their CSV
files, this varied from 7(Barrow) to 15(South Lakes). I created a spreadsheet
of all the file headers. Some were easy to map, for instance ‘payment_amount’,
‘payment_date’, ‘supplier_name’. Others, for instance category required a bit
more effort, checking out the number of unique types available in the data set.
The spreadsheet can be found here. It’s not perfect as some files didn’t
contain the data fields to map or I used a high level category value where no
directorate information was available.

Using the https://validator.opendata.esd.org.uk/spend[LGA data validator] 
page I came up with a table definition for an aggregated table. The items I 
chose where mainly mandated items and one recommended item. I then created this 
in PostgreSQL

[source,sql]
----
create table organisation_expenditure_v1
(
        nwod_id_uri_code char(20) NOT NULL,
        nwod_id int NOT NULL,
        org_short_name character varying NOT NULL,
        org_directorate character varying,
        service_category character varying,
        beneficiary_name character varying,
        payment_date date,
        amount numeric(20,2),
        purpose_of_spend character varying,
        merchant_category character varying
);
----

The table columns are defined below

.organisation_expenditure_v1
[%header,cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Column Number | 	Column Name	 | Data Type | 	Description
| 1	nwod_id_uri_code | 	varchar	 | ONS district code. eg E07000026 for Allerdale
| 2	nwod_id | 	int | 	The auto generated row number from the council staging table, used for quick look ups of the original non aggregated data rows
| 3	org_short_name | 	varchar	 | single word name for a council
| 4	org_directorate | 	varchar	 | Directorate, service or department where an expense ocurred
| 5	service_category | 	varchar	 | A high level category for the spend. CIPFA SerCOP objective category label
| 6	beneficiary_name | 	varchar	 | Recipient of the spend
| 7	payment_date | 	date | 	The payment date as recorded in the department's purchase or general ledger (yyyy-mm-dd)
| 8	amount | 	numeric | 	The actual value of the payment net of recoverable VAT
| 9	purpose_of_spend | 	varchar | 	Description of the purpose of the expenditure
| 10	merchant_category | 	varchar | 	General headings that describe the nature of expenditure, for example, computers, software etc.)/Common Procurement Vocabulary(CPV) category of spend or Proclass label
|===

To get the data into the main aggregated table I created a population SQL file
for each council that selected all the data out of the staging table and into
the final table, this is where I mapped the staging columns to the target table
and converted the ‘payment_amount’ into a numeric data type.

[source,sql]
----
insert into organisation_expenditure_v1
(
        nwod_id_uri_code,
        nwod_id,
        org_short_name,
        org_directorate,
        service_category,
        beneficiary_name,
        payment_date,
        amount,
        purpose_of_spend,
        merchant_category
)
select
        nwod_id_uri_code,
        nwod_id,
        'allerdale',
        Service_Area,
        Expense_Type,
        Supplier_Name,
        Date,
        CAST(Amount as numeric(20,2)),
        Narrative,
        NULL
from allerdale_spend_2019;
----

I only had one error on the numeric conversion where a South Lakes value had a
series of spaces instead of a valid amount. I updated this to ‘NULL’ value – ie
‘not know’ rather than zero.

== Sanity Checking the Table

=== Data Coverage

The first thing I wanted to look at is how much data is available in the table
so looked at the number of columns with NULL values in them

[source,bash]
----
  council   | tot_rows | od_nulls | sc_nulls | bn_nulls | pd_nulls | a_nulls | pos_nulls | mc_nulls
------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+----------
 allerdale  |     5859 |       57 |        3 |        0 |      305 |       0 |         0 |     5859
 barrow     |     3269 |     3269 |        0 |        0 |        0 |       0 |         0 |     3269
 carlisle   |     8364 |        0 |        0 |        0 |        0 |       0 |         0 |     8364
 copeland   |     1850 |     1850 |        0 |        0 |        8 |       0 |         0 |     1850
 eden       |     1612 |        3 |        0 |        0 |        0 |       0 |         0 |     1612
 southlakes |     6895 |        2 |        2 |        2 |        2 |       3 |       167 |     6895
(6 rows)
----

I’ve split the data out by councils the columns are defined below

* *tot_rows* – total number of rows of data per council
* *od_nulls* – number of NULL values in org_directorate column
* *sc_nulls* – number of NULL values in service_category column
* *bn_nulls* – number of NULL values in beneficiary_name column
* *pd_nulls* – number of NULL values in payment_date column
* *a_nulls* – number of NULLS in amount column
* *pos_nulls* – number of NULLS in purpose_of_spend column
* *mc_nulls* – number of NULLS in merchant_category column

From this we can see that there is no merchant_category data also the
org_directorate data is missing for two councils. We do have quite good
coverage for service_category, beneficiary_name, payment_date, amount and
purpose_of_spend.

=== Amount Column

.Absolute min/max values per council
[source,sql]
----
spends=# select org_short_name,min(amount),max(amount)
spends-# from organisation_expenditure_v1
spends-# group by org_short_name order by org_short_name;
 org_short_name |    min    |    max
----------------+-----------+-----------
 allerdale      | -37500.00 | 378102.25
 barrow         | -21948.61 | 481805.53
 carlisle       | -22513.04 | 250651.12
 copeland       |  -4230.00 | 442558.02
 eden           |  -9870.66 | 240000.00
 southlakes     | -13460.00 | 295329.00
(6 rows)
----

So we can see from the above that there are some quite large negative values in
the table, this isn’t surprising as these values are from a ledger system so
repayments or refunds will have line entries. It also means that the general
title of ‘Spends over £500’ isn’t as simple as it sounds! Now let’s look at the
minimum/maximum values above and below zero

.Max/mins above zero
[source,sql]
----
spends=#  select org_short_name,min(amount),max(amount)
spends-# from organisation_expenditure_v1
spends-#  where amount > 0 group by org_short_name;
 org_short_name |  min   |    max
----------------+--------+-----------
 carlisle       |   0.07 | 250651.12
 barrow         | 400.93 | 481805.53
 southlakes     |   0.60 | 295329.00
 eden           | 500.00 | 240000.00
 copeland       | 500.00 | 442558.02
 allerdale      |   0.01 | 378102.25
(6 rows)
----

.Max/mins below zero
[source,sql]
----
spends=# select org_short_name,min(amount),max(amount)
spends-# from organisation_expenditure_v1
spends-# where amount < 0 group by org_short_name;
 org_short_name |    min    |   max
----------------+-----------+---------
 carlisle       | -22513.04 |   -0.02
 barrow         | -21948.61 | -503.20
 southlakes     | -13460.00 |   -2.15
 eden           |  -9870.66 | -528.00
 copeland       |  -4230.00 | -522.82
 allerdale      | -37500.00 |   -0.01
(6 rows)
----

So from this we can infer that Carlisle, South Lakes and Allerdale Councils
report all data down to the penny and Barrow, Eden and Copeland apply a lower
limit, £500 for Eden and Copeland and £400 for Barrow.

If we look at the number of distinct service categories for each district you
can see there are between 65 and 197 different categories in each council

[source,sql]
----
spends=# select count(distinct(service_category)),org_short_name
spends-# from organisation_expenditure_v1 group by org_short_name;
 count | org_short_name
-------+----------------
   197 | allerdale

=== Payment_date Column

The dates vary from December 2008 to January 2020

[source,sql]
----
spends=# select org_short_name,min(payment_date),max(payment_date) 
 from organisation_expenditure_v1 group by org_short_name;
 org_short_name |    min     |    max              <1>

----
<1> Range of payment dates by council
<2> The ‘2008-12-13’ date seems to be an error, all the other earlier dates relate to 2018 most of them from November onwards
<3> Number of dates less that 2019-01-01

=== Org_directorate Column

Again there are various classifications used by each council, some councils don’t report any so this column probably won’t be that useful for future queries

[source,sql]
----
spends=# select count(distinct(org_directorate)),org_short_name
from organisation_expenditure_v1 group by org_short_name;
 count | org_short_name
-------+----------------
    13 | allerdale
     0 | barrow
   206 | carlisle
     0 | copeland
    23 | eden
    27 | southlakes
(6 rows)

== Conclusions
Clearly this aggregated data set has some issues with respect to cross council comparisons. To review the columns

* * nwod_id_uri_code*  – Created as part of the load
* * nwod_id*  – Created as part of the load, provides a quick look up to the original staging table
* * org_short_name*  – Created as part of the load
* * org_directorate*  – No consistent cross council data
* * service_category*  – There may be a possibility of creating a look up table to create a dozen or so broad divisions
* * beneficiary_name*  – A lot of the problems described here could be fixed, eg make all the values upper case, change all ‘LIMITED’ to LTD, normalise all names etc
* * payment_date*  – Quite good data
* * amount*  – Quite good data, may have to consider limiting all data sets to +/- £500
* * purpose_of_spend*  – This is largely free text, useful for looking at specific items rather than cross council analysis
* * merchant_category*  – No data provided

I think the next step will be to try and make some of the ‘improvements’
outlined above and start thinking about some of the information that can be
extracted from the data. I’m reasonably happy with the amalgamated table, but I
need to ‘improve’ the quality beneficiary and category columns without losing
accuracy.
