== Background

I started this project in January 2020 and initially set up a Wordpress(WP) site
to document the learning process. I think WP is pretty good, it's free, easy to
install and use. It's got hundreds of themes and plugins, it's easy to manage,
relatively secure and commercially adaptable. With that said _what's my problem_? 

Well on reflection I don't feel this is a blog, it's an exploration of a problem,
more like an obervational scientific field notebook, where the 'observations' are
suitable for a 'blog' style but there is not the space for the 'synthesis' articles
and the continual reworking of the work.

There's also an element of IT fundamentalism at play, the data source of a WP site
is a https://www.mysql.com/[MySQL] database. When hosting commercially you are likely
to be running on a shared server this will impact user performance and to a certain 
extent the writers process. I found the performance quite slow also I found myself 
spending more time writing posts than doing what I enjoyed.

I like markdown languages, which are shorthand for html, they are easy to learn, 
fast to write in a bare bones text editor. I've used AsciiDoc for several years
and AsciiDoctor in particular. It's feature rich yet readable in it's source *but*
more importantly it's ascii, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca[lingua franca] 
of computing. I can take them between operating systems, store them in
source code control systems, write scripts to generate pages. 

There's a rich ecology developing around AsciiDoc, I had considered adopting 'Hugo'
as a website platform but my background use of AsciiDoc finally nudged me in the 
direction of adopting Antora as my static website generator. I also realised Antora
was much more than a documentation site generator and I would only be interested in 
a few of it's features and would be looking to remove alot of the options available 
by default.

The following are some basic technical points and reminders to myself for working 
with Antora to create a static website. I would point out I am no expert in node, 
html, css or javascript in general. I read the Antora docs and did a bit of '_playing_'

== Installation

* https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install-and-run-quickstart/[Quickstart Guide] 
 I would stop at 'Create a playbook' if you are new to Antora
* There are detailed guides for Linux, Window or MacOS.
* I did the installation on Cygwin and found no issues with the documentation

NOTE: Did I??

NOTE: After installation you need to understand the filesystem layout *before* you get
involved in setting up any `.yml` files

== Configure Directories

A content source is a git repository, I think the minimal requirement is a `git init` 
followed by a commit on a local filesystem. Once I had the structure complete and a few
pages written I committed/pushed to GitHub to test the full Antora build.

.Source Filesystem
----
README.md                <1>
antora.yml               <2>
./.git                   <3>

./modules/ROOT/images
./modules/ROOT/pages
./modules/ROOT/partials
----
<1> The repo README file
<2> The site's antora.yml file
<3> .git directory, subdirectories snipped
<4> The modules directory is the top level of the sites content
<5> The blog subdirectory
<6> The docs sub directory
<7> The ROOT sundirectory - ROOT is a special key word that
 signifies a space for non specific files, this will become clearer when you see the output
 structure after running Antora. Basically I thought I would place my index page,
 privacy and T&C pages


In each 'ROOT', 'blog' and 'docs' directory I created some subdirectories. These were the 
locations of the content files, content types are described below. Not all are compulsory.

|===
| Directory | Purpose | Access method
| attachments | For files to download eg .tar, .zip etc | AsciiDoc `link:` directive
| examples | For source code, terminal output, .csv data sets | AsciiDoc `include::` directive
| images | For image files included in pages(.png,.jpg,.svg,.gif) | AsciiDoc `image::` or `image:` directives 
| pages | AsciiDoc files(.adoc) These are automatically converted to .html | n/a
| partials | AsciiDoc fragments eg a table or list to be included in multiple .adoc pages | AsciiDoc `include::` directive

== Playbooks and Yml's

=== antora.yml

The `antora.yml` is located in the root level of the repository, it signals to
Antora the modules directory it also signals the version metadata


Here's my antora.yml

----
name: nwod                           <1>
title: Northwest Open Data           <2>
version: master                      <3>
nav:                                
- modules/ROOT/partials/nav.adoc     <4>
- modules/blog/partials/nav.adoc
- modules/docs/partials/nav.adoc
----
<1> Together with `version` uniquely identifies component version
<2> Used in pages, version selector, breadcrumbs etc
<3> Together with `name` uniquely identifies component version
<4> Identifies Navigation Files(`nav.adoc`) - more on this later

See https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/component-version-descriptor/#locate-content-source-root-with-antora-yml[here] for futher information

=== antora-playbook.yml

This was my basic antora-playbook.yml

----
site:       <1>
  title: North West Open Data                 
  url: https://northwestopendata.org.uk

content:    <2>
  sources:
    - url: https://github.com/northwestopendata/nwod_www
      branches: main

ui:         <3>
  bundle:
    snapshot: true
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
----
<1> This is the site name and url of the website
<2> This defines where the content can be found, in this case GitHub, but it could be a local directory
<3> This is the UI or the theme to use. Antora splits content from theme.

== Building 

You can then generate a website by running antora from the command line

----
 antora antora-playbook.yml
----

A local directory was created called `build` containing the generated html files, images and
in the `_` directory the css, fonts, javascript etc required

----
$ find .  -type d
.
./site
./site/nwod
./site/nwod/blog
./site/nwod/blog/_images
./site/nwod/docs
./site/nwod/docs/_images
./site/nwod/_images
./site/_
./site/_/css
./site/_/font
./site/_/img
./site/_/js
./site/_/js/vendor
----

== The Default Output

image::antora1.png[]

. The site name (site: title)
. Default navigation features, links and drop downs
. A download button for the page
. The site name (site: title) again 
. The breadcrumb location
. This allows editing of the file on GitHub
. The site navigation, created with nav.adoc files(antora.yml)
. The web page
. The table of contents(toc) for the page

[start=10]

. The version navigation widget
. The page footer

== Theming with the UI
