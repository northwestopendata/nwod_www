The last two weeks in summary…

== Pros

* I’ve manually reviewed all company name data and resolved cross council
mismatches and spelling mistakes for the six Cumbrian councils, reducing
distinct companies from circa 3900 to circa 3100. Learning a lot of the common problems
along the way
* Got a handle on some of the council category information, parking that for the future.
* Attended an https://www.opendatamanchester.org.uk/[Open Data Manchester] Pick ‘n’ Mix 
session on APIs by https://twitter.com/r_solymosi[Reka Solymosi]. Which got me thinking 
about data enrichment and reference data for working with expenditure data.
* Started reorganising my scripts and data that I’ve collected and decided to put
it on https://github.com/northwestopendata/lgtc_refdata[Github]. This includes 
ihttps://github.com/northwestopendata/lgtc_refdata/tree/master/proclass_17[ProClass] 
category data with an API over the CSV file via GitRows ( a great idea from 
https://twitter.com/NicolasZimmer[Nicholas Zimmer]) at https://twitter.com/gitrows[GitRows].
* Also included in the repo is https://github.com/northwestopendata/lgtc_refdata/tree/master/CoHouseLite[CoHouseLite]. 
This is a subset of the full CH
data set(`Company name, Number, Address, Category, Status and SICC code`). I’ve
made this available as a single file for database import and a zip archive
with 5 files split in 1,000,000 chunks which will probably be more useful for
a spreadsheet/desktop application user.
* Started writing a Company Name matching algorithm in SQL.
* Thinking about other ways to enrich the spending dataset, the company name and
number can link out to Companies House with Director names and Persons with
Significant Control, but also company addresses which add a geographic element
to maybe look at payment flows in and out of a council

== Cons

* Realised that of the expenditure data that I’ve collected for the six Cumbrian
councils the only data I really trust is the date and amount of payment.
* Started writing a Company Name matching algorithm in SQL.(It’s not easy and
probably will never be 100% accurate)
* Concluded that there’s a real problem with Category data in these data sets –
this is released under the https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408386/150227_PUBLICATION_Final_LGTC_2015.pdf[Local Government Transparency Code], it’s open data
*but* some of the systems used are propriety, in fact there’s an eco system of
companies working in this area that depend on it remaining so.
* Coming to the conclusion that I’m spending a lot of time on this and it
shouldn’t be that difficult.

CoHouseLite and ProClass datasets can be found on GitHub.
