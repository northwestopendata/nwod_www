_Part 2 : A look at Data Scope and Categories in local government spending data_

== Introduction

Having spent the last few months collecting Local Government spending data for
most of the councils in the North West of England I thought I’d collect
together in a series of posts some of the technical issues I’ve encountered
compiling the data sets. In xref:sww_i.adoc[Part I] I I looked at issues related to CSV file
formats and date reporting, in  xref:sww_ii.adoc[Part II] I covered payment amounts and
beneficiary names. In this part I will look at the scope of the data and touch
on category information and why it doesn’t really help comparing individual
councils.

== Data Scope

The Section 2, paragraph 28 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408386/150227_PUBLICATION_Final_LGTC_2015.pdf[Transparency Code] states that the following items
must be published

* individual invoices
* grant payments
* expense payments
* payments for goods and services
* grants
* grant in aid
* rent
* credit notes over £500, and
* transactions with other public bodies

The Local Government Association includes the above but adds the following
specific exclusions

* transactions relating to income or the financing or underwriting of debt
* financing and investment expenditure
* payments made to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for value added tax (VAT), pay as you earn (PAYE) and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) or pensions.
* salary payments to staff (this is covered separately by the Code)
* compensation payments to individuals.

Having worked with several councils spending datasets from 2019 it occurred to
me that equivalent councils have a different ‘feel’ to them. I think I first
noticed this with ‘Teachers Pension’ payments, a few councils reported these
most did not.

I have a suspicion that councils do not report the same items and think the
easiest way to demonstrate that hypothesis is by looking at payments to Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, what should be excluded is specified in the
above LGA guidance.

To demonstrate some of the problems working with these datasets, HMRC appears
in many forms which need to be resolved to a single name for comparison across
councils

Eight councils out of 26 record no payments to HMRC, of the councils that do
record payments they vary from £748 to nearly £49 million, is this variance in
amounts credible, to me it seems unlikely, looking at the number of payments
over 2019, there is a rough correlation between amount paid and number of
payments. Let’s take a closer look at some council payments to see if there is
some category information that might shed some light on what the payments are
and if they are actually items that should be excluded.

Let’s take a closer look at Trafford, which has 151 payments totalling
£38,152,822.24

From the above query we can see that National Insurance and PAYE payments are
included totalling nearly £37 million. Stockport doesn’t provide any meaningful
categorisation of the HMRC payments. Blackburn with Darwin include NI payments
including deductions and employer contributions. Other items appear in these
and many councils payments to HMRC

* Student Loans payments
* Apprenticeship Levy payments
* State maternity payments – effectively as refunds
* Construction Industry Scheme(CIS) payments

It is unknown if the above items should be reported under the transparency code
or the LGA guidance. When you also consider the Expenditure Range issue
highlighted in xref:sww_ii.adoc[Part II] of these posts I think it would not be unfair to say the
lack of consistency across councils makes the spending data less than useful
for cross council comparisons.

== Category Data
Councils are required to provide a ‘merchant category(eg. computers, software
etc)’ presumably to provide a high level of classifying the purpose of
payments, sounds great doesn’t it? The LGTC does not expand on this. The LGA
guidance mentions ‘Procurement classification / merchant category’ and suggests
using either

* https://proclass.org.uk/[Proclass] – is local government owned and is made freely available to any UK public sector organisation
* https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/digital/common-vocabulary_en[The Common Procurement Vocabulary](CPV) – A European Commission standard code system for public procurement.

I’ve seen references in the raw data files to two other classification methods

* https://www.cipfa.org/policy-and-guidance/publications/s/service-reporting-code-of-practice-for-local-authorities-202021[CIPFA/SeRCOP](was BVACOP) – Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy proprietary system, it is required when reporting to Central
Government
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Refinitiv_Business_Classification[Thomson Reuters Business Classification](TRBC)

When researching around the subject I’ve seen the following systems mentioned

* https://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=list%2Fservices[Local Government Service List](LGSL) – maintained by LGA
* https://www.ungm.org/Public/UNSPSC[United Nations Standard Products and Services Code}(UNSPSC)

=== Observations

* Some councils produce no category data eg. Rochdale, Sefton and Wirral
* Some councils use a subjective system, either they create their own or tailor
 an existing one for specific local requirements, for example Bolton, see
 below for some of their categories

* St Helens claims to report CIPFA data but the columns are empty
* Cheshire East report 3 levels of Proclass code and a Thomson classification
* Other councils report just one level of Proclass and lets the user figure out
which it is, and it won’t be the same as the adjacent council.
* There is usually no metadata explaining what system is being used and the
column headings may not be helpful
* There appears to be a blurring of definitions with this item, are they meant to be
** A vendor classification
** A financial or accounting classification
** A business area classification

The approach I took was to use the Companies House SIC Code for the companies I
had identified, this obviously leaves some expenditure unclassified and
unclassifiable. I did create one category here ‘Inter/Intra Council Spending’
which represents the money flow between different local authorities. Here’s an
example of an attempted comparison of the Greater Manchester Councils
expenditure

https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4239576/[image::Greater-Manchester-All-Spending-2.png[]]

== Conclusions

* Local authorities make payments to a huge range of suppliers, these may be
commercial, charitable, governmental or even individuals via possibly multiple
payment systems, when reporting it is not unsurprising that the scope of what
is reported in the absence of precise definitions may result inconsistencies
when comparing between councils.
* Clearer guidance could be provided by the LGA or government in future editions
of the transparency code.
* The current situation where councils may or may not provide category data, or
provide different category classifications or different levels of the same
category systems makes cross council comparison virtually impossible.
* SIC codes provide a slightly better solution but large areas of payments fall
out of SIC classification.

That’s the final post looking at some of the quality issues associated with
this data, overall I think the spending dataset is important for transparency
purposes. I don’t think it would be difficult to improve the overall quality
and comparability but I doubt there is much will to make the required changes.
