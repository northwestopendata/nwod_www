_Part 2 : A look at Payment Amounts and Beneficiary Names issues in local government spending data_

== Introduction

Having spent the last few months collecting Local Government spending data for
most of the councils in the North West of England I thought I’d collect
together in a series of posts some of the technical issues I’ve encountered
compiling the data sets. In Part I I looked at issues related to CSV file
formats and date reporting, in this post I’m looking at payment amounts and
beneficiary name.

The Local Government Transparency Code states that the following must be published

* date the expenditure was incurred
* relevant local authority department
* beneficiary
* summary of purpose
* amount
* VAT that cannot be reclaimed
* merchant category (eg. computers, software etc)

== Payment Amounts

=== Expenditure Format
There are two key aspects of payment data, the first is obviously the actual format of the payment amount. Here’s four basic forms of ten thousand pounds.

----
1. £10,000.00
2. 10,000.00
3. 10000.00
4. £10000.00
----

From a data ingestion viewpoint none of these provide any major issues, as I
described in the http://www.northwestopendata.org.uk/so-whats-wrong-with-council-spending-data-part-i/[first part of this series] I validate dates by importing into a
stage table with a date type defined, in the second stage of the process I
clean up the amount column, removing ‘£’ symbols and ‘commas’ then cast them
into a numeric(20,0) datatype, this facilitates all normal number operations on
the column.

=== Expenditure Range

This is a slightly less obvious aspect of spending open data but it’s a subject
I will come back to more broadly in a later post, but looking at it here
provides a good introduction to an issue that can affect *comparability* of data
sets across councils.

Most of the spending data will come from Commercial Payments Systems. They will
be used primarily by the Finance Departments and used by Invoice processors.
Processing invoices will include paying the amount due but may also include
reimbursements(un-payments if you like) to the Council. These will either be
full or partial negative amount payments, here’s a selection of the top
reimbursements noted.

----
council    | amount      | beneficiary
manchester | -5229311.00 | LAING O'ROURKE CONSTRUCTION LIMITED
trafford   | -3425016.78 | STRETFORD HIGH SCHOOL
liverpool  | -2569589.60 | MERSEYSIDE RECYCLING AND WASTE AUTHORITY
manchester | -2537412.00 | LAING O'ROURKE CONSTRUCTION LIMITED
manchester | -1737217.09 | VESTA STREET DEVELOPMENT LTD
----

These can be quite significant amounts that if removed can distort the councils
payments profile. There are some distinct variations in reporting across
different councils.

* Some councils delete all payments less than £500, including all reimbursements

----
council  | min    | max         | sum
bolton   | 500.00 | 5632365.99  | 175317348.01
bury     | 500.00 | 1665139.00  | 149820096.13
oldham   | 500.00 | 1695925.36  | 224118911.65
cheseast | 500.00 | 4595034.18  | 414341570.17
sefton   | 500.00 | 1860500.00  | 260696084.15
wigan    | 500.00 | 10700000.00 | 360843319.69
----

* Some councils include all payments greater than zero but delete all reimbursements

----
council  | min    | max         | sum
halton   | 0.01   | 1190830.92  | 184841274.67
sthelens | 0.03   | 1205418.41  | 177514379.95
----

* Some councils delete all payments/reimbursements between -£500 and £500.
 Technically I consider this to be the correct approach, as major
 reimbursements will be included

image::GMCA-Payments-by-percentile.png[]

Clearly this will affect comparisons between councils when the data sets are
not equivalent, we can’t just use the best data sets we have to delete
everything below £500 for *all datasets* to make them more comparable. A poor but
forced solution.

== Beneficiary Names
Councils in the North West are quite variable in size, the Cumbrian Councils
spend between £10 and £25 million, the councils in the GMCA vary between £150
and £785 million for 2019, the larger ones could be compared to FTSE100
companies. One characteristic of their payment beneficiaries is their
diversity, they include

* Companies private and public
* PFI structures
* Agencies and Public Bodies
* Other councils, parish, town, district and combined authorities
* Public corporations
* Central government
* Education/Training organisations
* Employment organisations
* Trade/Professional associations
* Medical Trusts/Clinical Commissioning Groups
* Law/order/emergency services
* Charities, community groups and voluntary groups

Typically a council will have between 2000 and 2500 suppliers reported in their
spend data, over 75% will be a registered company, they may be companies that
have charitable status but they will have an entry in the Companies House
dataset. The remaining beneficiaries will more than likely appear in the
Charities Commission Dataset, The Register of Schools, the Care Quality
Commission dataset or government authority lists. By matching to these datasets
it aligns all the possible variations that arise to single identifiable
entities to a common standard and makes the datasets from different councils
comparable. Additionally the data become linkable to other datasets and
enriches it’s use. For instance the SIC code from Companies House can be used
as a proxy for a spend category, see https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4239576/[here] for a first attempt on the GMCA
councils.

The following is a review of some of the technical challenges of implementing a
matching process, it’s not exhaustive but I hope gives the reader a feel for
the challenges and the quality of data on offer.

=== Accuracy

The table below shows what percentage of beneficiary names exactly match the
Companies House dataset, most fall within the 20-30% range, typically they have
three or more words in the company name. The total suppliers is also provided
to provide some idea of total number of commercial suppliers(circa 75% of TS)

[%header]

=== Abbreviations
Abbreviation often appear in beneficiary name and cause problems when trying to
identify the underlying organisation, there are over 400 Associations in the 25
council 2019 dataset, different councils use different variations

* ASSOC – eg ASSOC OF DEMOCRATIC SERVS OFFICERS
* ASSOC. – eg ASSOC. OF DIR. OF PUBLIC HEALTH
* ASS – eg ASS OF DIRECTORS OF CHILDREN`S SERVICES LTD
* ASSOCI. – eg DISTRICT SURVEYORS ASSOCI. LTD

All of the above may appear at the start, middle or end of the string, they
also use other abbreviations such as SERVS and DIR. Then they may just appear
as their initials

* ADASS – meaning ASSOCIATION OF DIRECTORS OF ADULT SOCIAL SERVICES
* APSE – meaning ASSOCIATION PUBLIC SERVICE EXCELLENCE
* IRRV – meaning INSTITUTE OF REVENUES RATING AND VALUATION ASSOCIATIONS

Over 1200 beneficiary names have the ‘T/A’ string in them meaning ‘Trading as’,
such as

----
clean_name                                      | match_company_name
BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED T/A MEASURE 2 IMPROVE | BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED
BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED T/A MEASURE2IMPROVE   | BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED
BUILDING SOFTWARE LTD T/A MEASURE 2 IMPROVE     | BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED
BUILDING SOFTWARE LTD T/A MEASURE TO IMPROVE    | BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED
BUILDING SOFTWARE LTD T/A MEASURE2IMPROVE       | BUILDING SOFTWARE LIMITED
----

But frequently the real name of the company may appear on the other side of the
‘T/A’ string

----
clean_name 
CAE BRYN T/A PENDINE PARK NURSING HOME  
CHRIS HURST T/A HAWK ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES 
GARY LAYCOCK T/A NEW BRIGHTON HOTEL 
HYDE NURSING CARE HOME T/A MERIDIAN HEALTHCARE LTD
----

=== Line Item vs Beneficiary

This issue arises from the fact that most of the sources of spending data
resides in flexible payments software. Presumably when these are installed they
will be configured to the particular council departments needs. I first came
across this issue with the Cumbria dataset initially with utility payments

----
org_short_name | clean_name
copeland       | WATER PLUS COPELAND CENTRE CBC 4043252188
copeland       | WATER PLUS CIVIC HALL – 4221709037
copeland       | WATER PLUS CLEATOR MOOR COUNCIL CENTRE 4097096061
copeland       | BRITISH GAS (HAIG ENTERPRISE PARK)
copeland       | BRITISH GAS (CLEATOR MOOR OFFICES)
----

This became more of a problem as I looked at the Manchester and Liverpool
Combined Authorities data sets and payments to Care Homes started to appear

----
org_short_name | clean_name
halton         | BEECHCROFT CARE HOME (HC-ONE)
halton         | FAZACKERLEY HOUSE (MERIDIAN HEALTHCARE)
sefton         | HC-ONE LTD T/A SWALLOWNEST NURSING HOME
sefton         | MERIDIAN HEALTHCARE-GREATWOOD HOUSE
stockport      | BANKHOUSE NURSING HOME - HC-ONE
stockport      | RINGWAY MEWS NURSING HOME - HC-ONE
warrington     | HC-ONE OVAL SUMMERVILLE CARE HOME
warrington     | HC-ONE OVAL LTD BIRCH COURT
wigan          | WESTWOOD LODGE C/O MERIDIAN HEALTHCARE LTD
----

Initially I was focused on extracting or cleaning the data to get the company
names but it has occurred to me that in the second example the actual home has
significant public interest(similar issue arises with education
establishments). With the introduction of the Care Quality Commission dataset
this increased possibilities of a more detailed analysis of the Care Home
payments.

=== Initials

Consider a fictional company ‘X Y JONES’ the following variations could appear
in the council datasets

----
1. XY JONES - no space between initials
2. X.Y. JONES - full stops no spaces
3. X. Y. JONES - full stops and spaces
4. X Y JONES - actual company name
----

=== Dormant Company Issue

When I started to look at the SIC codes of matched companies another issue
appeared, some quite large companies appeared as ‘99999 – Dormant Company’.
Typical examples of this would be ‘BRITISH GAS LIMITED’ and ‘BRITISH TELECOM’.
Technically the supply side of British Gas plc split away as Centrica in 1997.
British Telecom changed it’s trading name in the early nineties and has now
become BT Group. This can be explained again by considering where the data
comes from, the company name was accurate at the time it was entered but hasn’t
been updated as corporate structures change, indeed I could imagine old payment
details being exported and imported through newer and newer council IT systems.
This issue does not just apply to large companies, the question it does raise
though if the company is dormant with respect to Corporation Tax, where is the
money being paid to. See more information on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormant_company[Dormant Companies here].

=== Dissolved Company Issue

On a similar issue to above, in 2019 Oldham Council paid £499,617.17 to Bardon
Aggregates, however according to https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00836912[Companies House] Bardon Aggregates was
dissolved in March 2017. There are over 400 companies in the combined dataset
that are currently flagged as being in a status of not ‘Active’ that could be
in ‘Liquidation’, ‘Administration’ etc. true many of them have changed status
since 2019 and it’s an area that needs further investigation.

=== Truncation

Many beneficiary names are truncated, Trafford consistently truncate to 35 characters

----
supplier_id | supplier_name                       | char_length
140299      | The Association of Electoral Admini | 35
160469      | Rehabilitation Workers Prof Network | 35
157142      | EE Limited (EEMP Messaging Charges) | 35
160205      | Massive Technical Solutions Limited | 35
158743      | Qualia Care Ltd T/A Millfield Nursi | 35
156667      | Elizabeth Marland Childrens Respite | 35
101973      | Chubb (Intruder & Fire Alarms Only) | 35
100447      | Broughton Hs Home For Ex-Servicemen | 35
159047      | Trading Standards Institute NW Bran | 35
156659      | Care 4 Children Residential Service | 35
----

Others truncate to varying lengths presumably as items are exported from
different IT systems before final release.

=== The Bolton Hash
A special mention to Bolton who release beneficiary names with the ‘#’ symbol
randomly scattered through them

----
BOLTON CHILDRENS OPPORTUNITY GROUP#COG
BOLTON COMMUNITY RADIO CIC#BOLTON FM CIC
BOLTON HINDUS' AGE INSPIRATION LTD#BHAI
BOLTON MISSION VICTORIA HALL#BOLTON METHODIST MISSION
BOLTON MUSIC SERVICE#BOLTON COUNCIL
BOLTON QUAKER MEETING#SOCIETY OF FRIENDS (QUAKERS)
BOLTON SHOPMOBILITY#COMMUNITY CARE OPTIONS
CEFNDY HEALTHCARE#CEFNDY ENTERPRISES
----

=== Apostrophes vs Grave

This was one I wasn’t expecting but there seems to a random tendency to
occasionally swap an apostrophe for the grave[ ` ] symbol. Indeed Blackburn
with Darwin seem to have remapped all their keyboards to do this.

== Conclusions

* Dates and amounts are technically relatively simple to deal with in these datasets.

* The real challenge is the hand entered beneficiary name, this is not unique
 to this dataset. See https://spendnetwork.com/finding-beneficiaries-of-public-money/[Finding Beneficiaries of Public Money] from The Spending
 Network. It’s a common complaint from people working in the field.

* In these days when you can enter a postcode in web page and populate a form
with your full address with one click it seems that the software providers are
missing a trick.

* It’s also apparent that, just as a name isn’t enough to identify a person, most
bodies ask for full name /date of birth or first line of address, companies
need to be identified more clearly if they are to be useful in the open data
ecology. I would suggest using COMPANY NAME/COMPANY NUMBER pair. Of the
datasets I’ve looked at only the South Lakes Council release Company Name and
Number.

* Trafford provides VAT Registration Number but I don’t think this is generally useful

* As for the stale company names, in a way that’s a matter of house keeping and
due diligence, but technologically it’s not impossible to fix.

* Many beneficiaries don’t appear in any reference lists, professional bodies,
scout/youth groups etc. I’ve started my own list to match some of these when
they occur across councils.

* Care Homes presents another issue, how do you uniquely identify them, should
councils report Care Home name or the provider name, there are 26 ‘*The Willows*‘
in the matching CQC dataset so that compounds the issue, reporting the provider
doesn’t really provide the granularity required of the user. Again a Care
Home/Company number pair would help in this area.

* Is it unreasonable to ask councils to record and report a company number,
possibly not, as part of the onboarding process these checks should be
undertaken.

* I don’t think it would be possible to fully match any council spending dataset
but I don’t think it would be impossible to get most above an 80% matched
figure. If that could be attained then this data might be considered fit for
purpose it was originally mandated from the local authorities.
