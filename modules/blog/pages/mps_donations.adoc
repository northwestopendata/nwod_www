== Introduction

Following winning the UK General Election in 2024 alot of 
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13871441/Keir-Starmer-justify-free-gift-worse-Labour-Baroness-Harman.html[press coverage appeared criticizing Labour MPs] for accepting donations and gifts from individuals and companies.
Most of the claims related to information in the 
https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/[Register of Members' Financial Interests]. This is available on the Houses of Parliament(HoP) website. 
It appears that at the start of this Parliamentary year they have mades some changes to what and how they release data.
All of this has been tracked by the folks at https://www.mysociety.org/[mySociety], the following articles will bring you 
up to speed on the changes and issue as well as some philosophical points about transparency being a hedge against reform.

_Disclosure : I'm a volounteer on their latest project mentioned in the last article_

== Method

* Ultimate data source root page : https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/
* Dataset page : https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/contents2425.htm
* Dataset Name : Register of Members' Financial Interests - as at 2 September 2024 (CSV Version)

As mySociety had already downloaded the files and created an Excel file available https://pages.mysociety.org/parl_register_interests/datasets/commons_rmfi/latest[here]. You can also https://data.mysociety.org/datasette/?mysoc=parl_register_interests/commons_rmfi/latest#commons_rmfi[Explore data in Datasette].
As this allowed me to run SQL against the various files/tables I did my initial 'look' with this tool. I chose the Category_2
file which contained donations data.
