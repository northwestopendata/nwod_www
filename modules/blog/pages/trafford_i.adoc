== Introduction

I’ve just released a consolidated and curated set of the Trafford Council
spending data over £500 for 2019. The following are some notes about
accessibility and observations about the data itself. Details of the data set
and the CSV file are available on https://github.com/northwestopendata/lgtc_nwod_data/tree/master/gmca[Github].

== Presentation and Accessibility

The Spending Data page is seen below, it’s clean and has files back to January
2016 with a link to an archive area. The https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/blog/local-spending-data-guidance[Local Open Data Panel] link is
broken. https://www.trafford.gov.uk/about-your-council/data-protection/open-data/supplier-spend.aspx[This link] reveals the following page

Unfortunately it’s not possible to use curl to download the page to extract the
CSV links nor can the CSV files be downloaded automatically, an attempt is
classified as an attack, complete with an ‘Attack ID‘ and the following

All files were downloaded manually, all in the UTF-8 character set, and after a
quick dos2unix were ready for loading into a Postgres database.

The files were very consistently named, the only criticism is with the month
name, either use full month name or a standard 3 letter abbreviation.

== The Data

I couldn’t find any description of the data on the website, but here’s a list
with the 3 items I’m interested in highlighted in red.
