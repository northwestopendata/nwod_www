== Introduction

I’ve just released a consolidated and curated set of the Trafford Council
spending data over £500 for 2019. The following are some notes about
accessibility and observations about the data itself. Details of the data set
and the CSV file are available on https://github.com/northwestopendata/lgtc_nwod_data/tree/master/gmca[Github].

== Presentation and Accessibility

The Spending Data page is seen below, it’s clean and has files back to January
2016 with a link to an archive area. The https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/blog/local-spending-data-guidance[Local Open Data Panel] link is
broken. https://www.trafford.gov.uk/about-your-council/data-protection/open-data/supplier-spend.aspx[This link] reveals the following page

Unfortunately it’s not possible to use curl to download the page to extract the
CSV links nor can the CSV files be downloaded automatically, an attempt is
classified as an attack, complete with an ‘Attack ID‘ and the following

All files were downloaded manually, all in the UTF-8 character set, and after a
quick dos2unix were ready for loading into a Postgres database.

The files were very consistently named, the only criticism is with the month
name, either use full month name or a standard 3 letter abbreviation.

== The Data

I couldn’t find any description of the data on the website, but here’s a list
with the 3 items I’m interested in highlighted.

----
body
body_name
payment_date                   <1>
transaction_number
invoice_number
amount                         <2>
supplier_name                  <3>
supplier_id
vat_registration_number
expense_area
expense_type
expense_code
bvacop
proclass
proclass_description
extended_description
profit_centre
----

There is proclass data, expense description information and unusually VAT
registration numbers but no department information. The profit_centre is just a
number and the ‘bvacop’ is an empty column.

=== Dates

* Date values imported with no problems – all with a standard DD-MM-YYYY format.
* The range was from 2019-01-02 to 2019-12-23

=== Amount

Some of the amount values had commas in the string values(about 17%), but these
are easily removed before casting the amount into a numeric format for use.

* There is no lower threshold of payments although the web page states that the lower limit of spends is £500
* There is £36,986,985.33 of expenditure between £0 and £500 and a total of
* reimbursements of £-4,236,441.00 between £0 and £-500. Making a total of
 £41,223,426.33 excess reporting(6%).

=== Supplier Name

All supplier names have been truncated to 35 characters, see below

* This issue affects less than 2% of the data but provides real issues when trying to match beneficiary names to reference data sets
* Some of the supplier names are really line items from an accountancy package rather than an actual beneficiary. This is best seen with retirement or nursing homes, see below

----

* Each home is represented by a separate line in the data. During processing where possible they have been consolidated into the actual beneficiary name.
* About 3% of the supplier names have ‘T/A’ which is used to identify companies and trading names of individuals and companies, this also aggravates the truncation problem see below.

* Trafford redact a very large proportion of their data, lets compare them to the other Manchester Councils

image::McrRedactedCouncil.png[]

* Trafford have the top 11 redactions by amount across the Greater Manchester area – a single redacted payment of over £24 million, and eight payments between £3-4 million.

== Results
* There are 2,289 distinct recipients receiving 179,839 payments in 2019
* I’ve managed to match beneficiary name to Companies House, Ofsted, Charities, Care Quality Commission and NHS Datasets.
* 76 % of beneficiaries have matched
* Over 80% of total spend has been matched to an organisation
* The Companies matching is the best quality and most comprehensive
* Company number & SIC codes have been added to the dataset
* More work needs to be done with Education/Charities and CQC
* The top 50 beneficiaries below or on https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/C8ivb/1/[Datawrapper here]

image::traff_bens.png[]

== Conclusions

* Trafford have actually produced a fairly good dataset
* 723 companies matched the exact name in the Companies House dataset, that’s over 30%
* It’s a shame the suppliers are truncated, as are some category information not used here
* The consistency of the files makes me think that they have an automated or semi automated process
* Their redaction policy on high value items does make me wonder, although that is probably a Finance Department issue not an IT policy
* There’s more information on the redactions in the raw data tables, most are
 ‘Capital Grants’ but two are for the purchase of buildings including the £24
 million line item, it’s interesting that both redacted purchases happened on
 7th March

* There was one company in the top 50 beneficiaries I couldn’t match, it looked a
well formed company name ‘*DEVONSHIRE (CIS TOWER) LTD*‘, I checked on Open
Corporates. It’s registered in Jersey, details https://opencorporates.com/companies?jurisdiction_code=&q=DEVONSHIRE+%28CIS+TOWER%29+LTD&utf8=%E2%9C%93[here]. That’s £13,750,000.00 into
the ‘trickle away’ economy. The directors/officers are listed as https://opencorporates.com/officers/274600887[SANNE FIDUCIARY SERVICES LIMITED] 
and seem to be administrators for several companies
based in Jersey. They were fined £381,000 last year for https://www.itv.com/news/channel/2019-07-17/sanne-fined-381-000-by-jersey-financial-services-commission['organise and control its affairs effectively‘]
