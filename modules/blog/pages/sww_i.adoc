_Part 1 : A look at CSV and Date issues in local government spending data_

== Introduction

Having spent the last few months collecting Local Government spending data for
most of the councils in the North West of England I thought I’d collect
together in a series of posts some of the technical issues I’ve encountered
compiling the data sets.

The Local Government Transparency Code states that the following must be published

* date the expenditure was incurred
* relevant local authority department
* beneficiary
* summary of purpose
* amount
* VAT that cannot be reclaimed
* merchant category (eg. computers, software etc)

I’ve discarded the “authority department” and “category information”, the
department data can change over time as councils are re-organised or more often
than not is missing. Briefly reviewing the category information provided it
became clear that different councils use different classifications, some openly
available others proprietary, the important issue being that they may be useful
for analysing a *single* council they are not helpful for comparing council
spending profiles.

The consequence of the above is that I am really only concerned with the
following for the purposes of this post

* Date expense was incurred
* Amount paid
* Beneficiary

The VAT exemption value is rarely reported by councils and it is assumed that
amounts reported exclude recoverable VAT. I’ve covered issues with with the
general accessibility of the data files in xref:blog:urlhuntingin_lancashire.adoc[URL Hunting In Lancashire] which
describes problems such as locating URLs, file names and formats. But I think
it’s important to look at the quality of the CSV files that are made available
before looking in more detail at the specific problems encountered with the
date/amount/beneficiary data.

== General CSV Format Issues

CSV or Comma-Separated Values is one of the most basic formats for transferring
data, it should be offered by every council for spending data, it is ideal for
tabular(accounting) data. The common format for CSV is described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180].
The https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/tabular-data-standard[Government Digital Service] offers further advice on it’s use with
clarification of it’s interaction with Excel. It seems that all the files I’ve
so far processed they have been through a spreadsheet at some point, they may
get pre-processed in a database but at some later stage they will be exported
to usually Excel for checking and probably redactions. Some of the problems
I’ve encountered

* *Excess columns* – here’s a header line defining 7 columns, with over 30
 commas at the end, implying blank column headers, all the data rows have a
 similar ending, this may be OK when you are loading it into a spreadsheet but
 is not helpful if you have to define database tables for import and requires
 further cleaning of the files. Thanks Halton!

* *Extra Header Lines* – RFC 4180 specifies zero or one header lines. Sefton Council add another title line above the header line

----

* *Different number of header columns vs data columns* – this is usually just an extra random comma at the end of some rows

* *Number of data columns varying each month or quarter* – Bury for example
 started 2019 reporting 8 columns of data, by March this had gone down to 7
 items but by June 10 columns were included in the file. As a slight twist on
 this the order of the columns have been seen to change in consecutive months.

* *Duplicate Columns or extra columns* – compare South Lakeland March and February files

* *Character Set or Code Page Encoding Issues*

Although not a part of RFC 4180, there is a mention of what encoding to use in
the final file on the Government Digital Service page. The UK government
specifies UTF-8. I have covered this before in previous posts – xref:blog:cumbria_spends_i.adoc[Cumbria
Spends – Database Import]. I think I’ve seen about a dozen encoding types from
‘Algol 68 source, Non-ISO extended-ASCII text’ to very old Windows types. Very
few councils offer files in clean UTF-8 format, xref:blog:trafford_i.adoc[Trafford Council] springs to
mind as the last one I’ve encountered.

[NOTE]
====
As a Windows desk top user you can see what character set a CSV file is by
opening it in ‘Notepad’ and check the field in the bottom right of the window

====

The vast majority of these issues can be solved by using a ‘CSV Validator’ I
use https://csvlint.io/[CSV Lint]. The LG Inform Plus provide https://validator.opendata.esd.org.uk/spend[a validator] and schema check which
seems to be rarely used judging by the general quality of CSV files produced by
local councils.

==  Date issues

=== Unparsable Dates

Generally the ‘date’ data is very good in general, a couple of issues have been
noted, the first I encountered in an Eden Council dataset

image::eden.png[]

The payment date ‘43507’ is not a valid date in any way. I contacted Eden
council and they got back to me with corrected files and stated ‘_it looks like
the cell formatting isn’t correct on those cells and so the date is displayed
as a 5 digit figure_‘

I had a similar problem with 900 rows of data from Tameside Council, I emailed
them 3 times and had no response, I set those dates to 01/01/2019 and moved on.

=== Typo Dates

Then there’s the ‘typo’ date, surprisingly few of these.

----
wirral | 64329 | 2018-12-20 | 20019-11-27
----

=== Out of Range Dates

For each data set I look at the minimum and maximum date in the compiled year
dataset. Some dates can be June 2018, in one case there is a date of 2008, is
this a typo(should it have been 2018). It’s difficult to know what to make of
these, it’s rarely clear if we are dealing with invoice, posting, payment or
other dates as there is rarely meta data explaining what dates are being
reported. In general I keep the dates as they are as there are usually so few
of this type.

I do truncate council data where they release quarterly datasets, as these are
usually done on a Financial year basis – with September usually making the end
of year.

=== Date Formats

In 2018 ODI Leeds did a report on Local Council Spends in which the author
Stuart Lowe noted the following variations in dates

----
    14 June 2012
    14th Jun 2012
    2012/06/14
    14.06.2016
    14/06/2012
    14/06/12
    06/14/12
    06/14/2012
    14-06-2012
    41072 (this is the number of days since 1900)
----

To this list I would add the following

----
    14-Jun-12

Stuart wryly notes 

[quote, Council spending data. (2018). Retrieved 18 November 2020, from https://odileeds.org/blog/2018-02-15-council-spending-data]
____
_The American format dates were the ones that caught me most by surprise (looking at you Sheffield City Council)._
____

I use a database import as the first step in validating data and as such by
creating a staging table with the date set as a ‘date datatype’ the failures
are very visible. I’ve found Postgres to be very good at interpreting a wide
variety of date formats – https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html[some documentation here]. I’ve encountered 3
councils(Oldham, St Helens and Wigan) that have adopted American style dates
for *some* of their files. It’s difficult to conceive that some months files can
have DMY and the next month can report MDY for a month then change back. As
Stuart notes in the his report

[quote, Council spending data. (2018). Retrieved 18 November 2020, from https://odileeds.org/blog/2018-02-15-council-spending-data]
____
_When the format of files change from month to month you almost feel like
someone is deliberately trying to make it hard for you to compare data_
____

Again the Government Code is not specific in this respect but the Government
Digital Service comes out with https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard[clear guidance]. https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html[ISO 8601] is their preferred
format which expresses dates as YYYY-MM-DD.

== Conclusion

* There aren’t many people using this data, of the few who are working in
this area that I’ve had contact with in the last few months there is a feeling
that as Stuart Lowe says ‘_almost feel like someone is deliberately trying to
make it hard for you to compare data_‘
* Council expenditure is a key dataset that ensures transparency and
accountability but it’s not an easy dataset to work with, I attended an online
session organised by https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/[The Bureau of Investigative Journalism] this afternoon and
it was clear that councils are under pressure and many don’t seem to be
responding in a ‘good’ way.
* It’s also apparent that transparency in spending data isn’t a priority even
before Covid-19.
* What is also obvious is that wouldn’t take much effort to improve or even fix
 the two issues highlighted in this post.
