== Introduction
I’ve just finished the expenditure data for the 10 councils in the Greater
Manchester Combined Authority for 2019, one of the first things that has become
apparent is the amount of beneficiary names that are redacted.

== Analysis

There are 120,475 rows of data with recipient names redacted of a total of
775,180 rows of data. That represents a massive 15.5%, the Cumbrian dataset has
only 1.8% redacted – an order of magnitude larger.

Rochdale, Stockport and Trafford account for the bulk of the redactions across
the ten councils of Greater Manchester. Rochdale redact 13% of all their
spending data by item. Bury by contrast redact less than 1%. In fact Bury
redacts so little data that it’s values don’t show on the pie charts below.

One council, Trafford account for nearly half the amount of total redactions

If we look at the chart below we see the average payment per redacted payment
Tameside makes fewer but higher value redactions.

We can look at the 15 largest redacted payments, we can see Trafford has a
single redacted payment of over £24 million, and eight payments between £3-4
million.

There’s more information on the redactions in the raw data tables, most are
‘Capital Grants’ but two are for the purchase of buildings including the £24
million line item. Most payments for properties that you see in the council
datasets are payments to Solicitors who are acting on the councils behalf in
the purchase, this accounts for the preponderance of legal firms in the top
quartile.

I’ve already outlined the Local Government Guidelines regarding redactions in a
previous post. The disparity in redaction levels highlighted here shows how
differently councils interpret the guidelines and to a certain extent says
something about the individual councils themselves.
