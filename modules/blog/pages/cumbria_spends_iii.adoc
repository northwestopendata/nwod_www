== Identifying Redactions
As part of my attempt to process the expenditure files of the six Cumbrian
Councils, one of the first thing to do is identify any redactions. This was
easily done with a SQL ‘like’ statement and the columns were updated to `\*** COMPANY NAME REDACTED ***`. 
Here are the original values from the raw
files(beneficiary_name) and the updated column I’ve created to hold matched
company names(company_name).

[source,sql]
----
select distinct(beneficiary_name),company_name,org_short_name 
from organisation_expenditure_v2 
where company_name like '%REDACTED%' 
group by beneficiary_name,company_name,org_short_name 
order by org_short_name; 

                   beneficiary_name                    |         company_name          | org_short_name
-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+----------------
 Redacted information - included personal information  | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | allerdale
 Redacted Information                                  | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | barrow
 REDACTED                                              | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | carlisle
 REDACTED                                              | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | carlisle
 Redacted information - including personal information | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | copeland
 redacted information                                  | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | eden
 Redacted information                                  | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | eden
 Redacted Information                                  | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | eden
 REDACTED INFORMATION                                  | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | eden
 Name redacted                                         | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | southlakes
 Name Redacted                                         | *** COMPANY NAME REDACTED *** | southlakes

== Cumbrian Redactions

There are 507 rows of beneficiary names redacted out of 27849 rows for the
calendar year 2019. That represents approximately 1.8%, there’s something
interesting about redacted information that informs beyond what is actually
concealed.

The Number of Redactions by Council shows that Allerdale are the most likely
council to redact information, 6% of their total data is redacted. Carlisle has
the next most redactions but by consequence of their higher number of payments
their redaction rate is less than 1%. Barrow only redacted one item in the
entire year, hence their slice of the pie charts is virtually invisible.

image::Cumbria_Amount_Redacted.png[]

The Amount Redacted by Council shows the cost of the redacted transactions per
council. Eden has redacted £437,364 worth of payments to suppliers. If we look
at the chart below we see the average payment per redacted payment and again
Eden looks very different to the other councils.

We can look at the 15 largest redacted payments, the top three are outliers.
Two payments of about £175,000 from Eden and a £97,000 payment from Carlisle

There’s more information in the raw data regarding the 2 Eden transactions

[source,sql]
----
select service_category_label,procurement_category,payment_date,amount 
from eden_spend_2019 
where nwod_id in (2973,2924);

        service_category_label        | procurement_category  | payment_date | amount
--------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------+--------
 1996 Discretionary Renovation Grants | Empty Property Grants | 2019-10-16   | 175530
 Economic Development and Promotion   | Professional fees     | 2019-11-01   | 175649
----

and the Carlisle payment

[source,sql]
----
select expense_area,expense_type,pay_date,line_goods_amount 
from carlisle_spend_2019 
where nwod_id=631;

         expense_area          |         expense_type          |  pay_date  | line_goods_amount
-------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------+-------------------
 Insurance claims below excess | Insurance Claims below Excess | 2019-01-16 | 97704.00

There’s more information available in the raw files and you can examine the
context of similar payments to gain a view on these and all other redacted
payments.

What the Spending Guidelines says about redaction –

[quote, (2020). Retrieved 3 August 2020, from https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/publishing-spending-and-p-485.pdf]
____
_Certain payments should be excluded or be redacted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Data Protection Act (DPA). These could be payments to certain private individuals or those that jeopardise security or an investigation into criminal matters. Please see the Freedom of Information and data protection section in the general publishing data guidance for more information._

____
_Any personal information that identifies an individual, or data that could lead
to harm to an individual, is excluded from publication. For example, the
publication of spending data would exclude payments related to children or
vulnerable adults – such as foster carers, home carers, any benefits payments
and personal refunds etc. However, supplier names, in general, do not fall
under any of the exemptions in the FOIA because they refer to a company rather
than an individual._
____

The document then provides two tables of examples of items that should be published and those that should be excluded or published with redaction.
